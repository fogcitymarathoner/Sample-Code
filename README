Below are 4 pieces of code that are 100% mine and are used on a daily basis,

   1. a CakePHP invoice model that's complex state machine for business,
   2. a Rails aggregator view that is simple, elegant and powerful,
   3. a single elegant CakePHP controller action,  a custom PayPal checkout for consignment sales that handles multiple-step transactions between 3 parties,
   4. a Python offsite-backup script that zips, encrypts, and ftps folders.
